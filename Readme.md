# Express-Weather-API

I created this API using three different open weather APIs.
From these three sources, given a param of a city, I pass a latitude and longitude coordinate to the APIs and
I received the JSON for current, hourly, and weekly forecast data and data about the US Air Quality Index.

This data was formatted into a consistent format to push to the client.

# Tech Stack
I used Express as the library and Jest for testing to ensure the data being received and pushed to the front end is formatted correctly. The backend is being hosted via render.com
